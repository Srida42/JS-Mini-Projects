            <h1>If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things</h1>
            <small>Jon McGregor</small>
            <p>"You must always look with both of your eyes and listen with both of your ears. He says this is a very big world and there are many many things you could miss if you are not careful. There are remarkable things all the time, right in front of us, but our eyes have like the clouds over the sun and our lives are paler and poorer if we do not see them for what they are. If nobody speaks of remarkable things, how can they be called remarkable?"</p>
            <h3>An excerpt from Jon McGregor, reflecting on the beauty in everyday moments</h3>

            <p>Additional notes: These lines stirred up some emotions when I first stumbled upon them, so I thought it would be a great addition to this project. In our busy day-to-day lives, we often fail to acknowledge the small moments around us. These things are easily overlooked unless we pay closer attention. What may seem ordinary can become significant when we share it, reflect on it, or hear someone elseâ€™s perspective. Shared experiences transform even the simplest things into something special. There is so much beauty around us, and it's something we should take the time to recognize and cherish more.</p>
